Coding Dojo DJango assignment "Surprise Me"

Surprise Me!
Make an app that serves up whichever number of random items the user requests. If the user enters '3' display 3 items on the next page.

At the top of your views.py, under your module imports add:

    VALUES = ['populate this list with various strings']

When a user enters a number and submits the form, shuffle the list of strings. You can access the above list from any view function. Return to the template n number of elements from the front of the list, where n is the value the user entered.

Display the strings in the template.
